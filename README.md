### Creation

- The original dataset is located at: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/


- As discussed in the paper, the following steps were followed to create the dataset:


1.  Pre-processing: Tokenization (done using spacy) and conversion to lower case.

2.  We further prune the corpus by removing the sentences that: were less than 3 words long, had more than 80% numeri-cal tokens, contained email addresses, or had repeatedoccurrences of spurious characters.


## Hand curated test-set

- The hand-curated test-set comprising of 800 sentences is present in this [repo](https://github.com/tag-and-generate/politeness-dataset/blob/master/politeness-curated-test.csv).  


## Dataset for training
- Dataset with the training ready format + only the ``is_useful == 1`` rows is located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E9GHwmVM9DL9-KiaIaG5lm_oagLWe908/view?usp=sharing
